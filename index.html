He was the Lord of the universe—strong, still, silent. Yet His heart was never untouched by love.

One day, a radiant goddess appeared before Him—Padmavati👀, full of grace and calm strength.
Their bond was deep, destined, divine. She became His eternal consort❤️, the one who stood beside Him in every yuga✨.

But somewhere, a young girl named Godha was dreaming. She didn’t ask for blessings. She didn’t want miracles. 
She only wished to offer her love—through garlands, songs, and silent prayers 💫.

And the Lord, with all the heavens watching, accepted her too😍. Not as a stranger, 
not even as a devotee—but as someone who loved Him without fear or expectation❤️‍🩹.

To one, He walked hand in hand✨.
To the other, He came when love called💫.

For the Lord does not measure love—He embraces every soul that offers it true❤️‍🩹.
